# Note web app
A secure multi-user authentication web-app developed using Py4web, Vue.js, and Bulma.css.

## Demo
The functionality of the app is the following:
1. The user can create, edit, and delete notes
2. The note contains a title and a body
3. The user can choose to change the color of a note or star a note (which will move the note to the front of all notes)
4. The notes will be sorted by most recently created/modified otherwise
5. The notes will be unique to each user, meaning that other users can't see notes that aren't theirs
6. Each user has a unique csrf session token for security
